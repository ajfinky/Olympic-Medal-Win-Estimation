# Olympic Medal Win Estimation
## Purpose
I created this project for one of my favorite classes at Penn, Probability Models in Marketing. Its main thesis is that there are a variety of business processes that follow common statistical distributions. It happens that over time, count data can be accurately fit to a Negative Binomial Distribution, which this project directly applies to Olympic medal wins. The fit is surprisingly good, even if the dataset I chose was not optimal! Check out Professor Peter Fader's work if this sounds interesting.
## Languages
- Excel (if that counts!? Probability Modeling is an MBA course, in which coding was not emphasized.)
## Set-Up Guide
All of the data is collected and tested in the Excel file attached. Please read the report if you want a detailed summary on its significance!
